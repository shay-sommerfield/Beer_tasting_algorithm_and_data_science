# Beer-tasting-experiment
![](images/all_beers_cropped.jpg)
While bubbled together during the pandemic,  a group of friends and I started doing blind taste tests for fun and to determine if we actually had "refined" taste or if we were just pretentious.

We eventually decided to do this with more standard lighter beer to determine if we could tell the difference and if our snobby attitude toward lighter beer was valid. The choices were the following, not particularly in any order:
* Rolling Rock
* Montucky Cold Snacks
* Miller High Life
* Rainier
* Kokanee
* PBR
* Coors Banquet
* Hamm's
* Modelo
* 10 Barrel Pub Beer (our craft control)
* Tecate
* Budweiser

## Setup
We did the test as a double blind so that no person would know which beer they were drinking. We quickly realized that the tastes of the beers were blending together since there were so many, so the here is the rating strategy we came up with:
1. Taste the first beer and then the second beer and rank them relative to each other
2. Taste the third beer and compare it to the first and second beer
3. Taste the 4 fourth beer and compare it to the middle ranked beer from the first three.
    * If it tastes better, compare it to your highest ranked beer
    * If worse compare to the lowest ranked beer.
4. Repeat this process for all beers, making comparisons as necessary until you have established a ranking.

## Results
The standard deviation shows our agreement among beer ranking. It appears that all five of us agreed that Montucky Cold Snacks was by far the best tasting, PBR is a decent middle of the pack beer, and that we all absolutely disliked budweiser. Anything else can just be considered preferential.
## What we would change
The beers got warm pretty quickly, so either cooling them somehow or having a cold version anonymized and ready would be important.

This taste test is exactly that a *taste* test. Because of that, one friend and I found we had a preference for Miller High Life while doing small tastes during the test, but did not enjoy drinking a whole beer.
